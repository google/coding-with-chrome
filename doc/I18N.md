Coding with Chrome - i18n translation
======================================

### Adding additional language support

#### Create language file
If your language is currently not support, create a new folder and language file
under `locales/[language code]/translation.json`.

For the language code, please use the ISO 639-3 definitions.
Example: `locales/deu/translation.json`

#### Add the language code to the supportedUserLanguage
Add the new language code to the supported user language in the file 
`src/locales/supported.js` like:
```diff
Locales['supportedLanguages'] = [
  'deu',
  'eng',
  'jpn',
+ '[language code]',
];
```

#### Add additional build rule
Create a new build rule in the file `build/cwc/locales.js`.

Example for the "deu" translation:
```javascript
/**
 * DEU Translation.
 */
closureBuilder.build({
  name: 'Locales.deu',
  srcs: glob([
    'locales/deu/translation.js',
  ]),
  externs: [
    'build/externs/locales.js',
  ],
  compress: true,
  out: 'genfiles/core/js/locales/deu.js',
});
```


### Additional language support
Take a look into the `locales/eng/translation.json` file and start translating
the different type of text.

Please make sure that you only add translated text into this new file.
It also fine to start with a few line and adding the rest later.

If the new file is ready, create an pull request under the following URL:
https://github.com/google/coding-with-chrome/pulls


### Translation of untranslated text
Perform the following steps:
* Enable the Debug mode under Settings -> Misc - Debug mode
* Restart the app
* Navigate around in the UI part you want to translate
* Open the Chrome Developer Tools inside the Coding with Chrome App
* Go to the "hamburger" menu and click on the "Debug" icon
* In the new window click on i18n Untranslated

This will return a list of all untranslated text for your language in the
Chrome Console, like:
```bash
Found 28 untranslated text for en
File: src/locales/eng/translation.js
  'Runs the code and update preview': 'Runs the code and update preview',
  'write(': 'write(',
  'Writes the text on the screen.': 'Writes the text on the screen.',
  'clear ()': 'clear ()',
...
```

Copy the output, add your translation and place them into the file
`locales/[language]/translation.json`.
 

### Missing translations
If you miss the translation for certain UI parts, please submit pull request to 
add them.

#### In JavaScript files
Use the global "i18t" function to add the translation to any text.
Please keep in mind that it could be that some text is already translated by 
general functions.
```js
  i18t('Some untranslated text')
```

#### In soy files
For soy files, use the {msg desc=""} {/msg} tags to mark any text.
Please keep in mind that it could be that some text is translated by 
general functions instead directly.
```js
  {msg desc=""}
    Welcome to Coding with Chrome!
  {/msg}
```
