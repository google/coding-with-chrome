Coding with Chrome is an Educational Development Environment built around two
core philosophies:
  1. Offer a stand-alone, offline app experience which allows people anywhere to
learn how to build useful computer programs:
    * A basic IDE able to support real programming work
    * A tutorial system that poses a challenge, checks the solution and
      provides feedback.

  2. Allow educators to put together a custom curriculum made up of various
components like:
    * input languages (blockly, javascript, coffeescript)
    * output modules (turtle graphics, javascript output, connected robots)
    * Flexible UI where elements can be easily added, modified or removed
    * Tutorial engine for self learning
