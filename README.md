Coding with Chrome is an Educational Development Environment built around two
core philosophies:

1. Offer a stand-alone, offline app experience which allows people anywhere to
   learn how to build useful computer programs:
   * A basic IDE able to support real programming work
   * A tutorial system that poses a challenge, checks the solution and
     provides feedback.
2. Allow educators to put together a custom curriculum made up of various
   components like:
   * input languages (blockly, javascript, coffeescript)
   * output modules (turtle graphics, javascript output, connected robots)
   * Flexible UI where elements can be easily added, modified or removed
   * Tutorial engine for self-learning
