Welcome to Coding with Chrome 6.01.05
=====================================

In this version we have a lot for you to try.

* [AIY](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/) Support (App only)

   AIY is a cardboard machine learning kit that Coding with Chrome can now
   control for you. Want to try some object recognition (have the computer
   look at a picture and tell you what's in it)? Or just make it go 'beep'?
   Try the AIY mode now!

* Tutorial Engine

  Coding with Chrome now has built-in interactive tutorials. We'll walk you
  through getting started with the user interface, Blockly, JavaScript and
  [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). Look for the
  *Tutorials* header in the Blockly, AIY and Programming/JavaScript sections.

* [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/intl/en/products/classroom/?modal_active=none)
  Improvements (App only)

  Does your teacher have new assignments for you in
  [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/intl/en/products/classroom/?modal_active=none)?
  You can now open them directly from the Coding with Chrome menu. Make sure
  you log in using the person icon in the upper right of Coding with Chrome to
  see the *Open Google Classroom* menu option.

* [Bluetooth BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) support

  We now support Bluetooth 4 (BLE) robots too, including the SPRK+. Try it out!

You can learn about lots of other minor changes in the change log below, pulled
directly from our [Open Source code repository on
Github](https://github.com/google/coding-with-chrome). Check there to see how
Coding with Chrome is built.
