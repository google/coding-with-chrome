Coding with Chrome has a special category for blocks that output text to the
screen: **Command**. Click **Command** in the toolbox. You'll see only two
blocks: *write()* and *writeLine()*.

Both blocks take a text block as input. This input to a block is called an
*argument* or a *parameter*. There's already a text block in the *write()* and
*writeLine()* blocks for you, but if there wasn't you could always drag one in
from the **Text** category of the toolbox.

*write()* simply prints text to the screen. *writeLine()* does the same thing
but makes whatever comes after it start on the next line - that is below and at the left
edge of the screen. It's like typing the **Enter** key after the text.
