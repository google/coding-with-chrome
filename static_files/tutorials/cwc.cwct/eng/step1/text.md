Coding with Chrome is divided into two sections: The *Editor* and the *Preview*. When you write code in the Editor (the center window pane) Coding with Chrome puts the results in the preview on the left.

You'll notice that the Editor pane for this file has a bunch of icons (*Command*, *Draw*, *Logic*, etc.). That's because this file uses *Blockly*, a graphical programming language. When you open a file containing text-based code such as JavaScript or Python, the Editor pane will show text instead.
