Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at
the end).

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if
you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to
sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### General Workflow

#### 1. Fork the Repo
You will find more details on [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

#### 2. If needed, sync/rebase the branch to the master branch
If the branch is even or ahead of master, you can skip this part.

In the case the branch is behind master, please sync/rebase the branch with the
master branch.

#### 3. Add your changes
Add your contribution and make sure to use as less needed commits or to squash
smaller commits.

#### 4. Test your changes
Please make sure your changes are working as expect and add additional unit or general tests to the test directory if needed.

#### 5. Create a pull request for the forked branch
If everything works as expect, create a pull request for your forked branch.
See: [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

#### 6. Merging into master branch
This step is handled by the "Coding with Chrome" team.
Depending on the change it could take up to 1 week before your change is merged
into the master branch and part of the bundled application.


### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.


### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the
[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).
